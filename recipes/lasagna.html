    <li>Add 1 tablesppon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
    <li>Return cooked bacon to skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry and sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan chees and toss again. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>
